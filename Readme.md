# type of binary tree
1. full binary tree

a tree either have 0 children or 2 children that type of tree called as full binary tree.

2. complete binary tree

A Complete Binary Tree is a type of binary tree in which all the levels, except possibly the last one, are completely filled, and all the nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. This ensures the tree is balanced to a certain degree.

3. perfect binary tree

A Perfect Binary Tree is a type of binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level. In other words, a perfect binary tree is completely filled at every level.

4. balanced binary tree

balanced binary tree is that tye of binary tree which length can be maximum log(n) where n is the number of the nodes

5. degenerate tree:
A Degenerate Tree (or Pathological Tree) is a type of binary tree where every parent node has only one child. This makes the tree essentially resemble a linked list, as there is no branching or balancing.
